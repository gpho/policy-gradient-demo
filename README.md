# A demo of REINFORCE: the simplest Policy Gradient reinforcement learning algorithm

REINFORCE is the most basic of policy gradient algorithms, a class of reinforcement learning algorithms.

As a project in Harvard's [Advanced Machine Learning, Data Mining, and Artificial Intelligence (CSCI E-82)](https://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/52820/assignments/syllabus) course in Fall 2018, I developed this notebook to demonstrate a simple implementation of the REINFORCE algorithm using TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenAI gym.

### Prerequisites

This code uses the following packages:

```
pip install gym
```
